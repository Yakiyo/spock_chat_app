# Svelte + TS + Vite

Prototype real time chat app using Svelte + Vite for frontend and Pocketbase for backend. Currently theres only one
general channel for every person to talk in. Using pocketbase was a pain since the api responses are kinda confusing
for me. Maybe writing a simplified custom backend server by my own self would let me do more shit. Or maybe using firebase
as an alternative. 

The code's base structure was taken from the amazing Fireships tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/gUYBFDPZ5qk?si=EUpa8rZLEfugrQ_3)
